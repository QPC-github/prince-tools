There are two ways to use the .NET interface in VB.NET: 

1) Use the DLL file Prince.dll.
2) Use the class file Prince.vb

If you are using Prince.dll, include the class library in your .NET project by 
adding a reference and browsing to the DLL file.

If you are using the Prince.vb, simply include this class file in your
.NET project and it is ready to go. 


To convert HTML (or XML) files into PDF, instantiate a Prince object with the Prince path.
This is the path of the prince.exe file.  Once this is done, style sheets, JavaScripts 
or other properties can be added by calling the appropriate subroutines. Finally, conversion 
can be done by calling one of the Convert functions in the Prince class:


The following code example demonstrates how to convert test1.html and test2.html
and merge them into one PDF file:

	Dim prn As Prince
        Dim doc_array() As String

	'instantiate Prince with princePath:
        prn = New Prince("C:\Program Files\Prince\Engine\bin\prince.exe")

	'add a stle sheet
        prn.AddStyleSheet("C:\docs\css\stylesheet-1.css")

	'add a JavaScript
        prn.AddJavaScript("C:\docs\js\test.js")

	'set the log file
	prn.SetLog("C:\docs\log.txt")

        'make an array of documents
        doc_array = {"C:\docs\test1.html", "C:\docs\test2.html"}

	'call convertMultiple to convert the documents to a PDF file
        prn.ConvertMultiple(doc_array, "C:\docs\pdf\merged.pdf")


To convert just a single document, call Convert instead of ConvertMultiple:

	prn.Convert("C:\docs\test1.html", "C:\docs\pdf\test1.pdf")



For C# users, the best way to use the Prince .NET interface is using the DLL.
Add a reference and browse to the Prince.dll file.

Prince object can be instantiated. Properties can be added and convert functions
can be called in a similar way:

	//instantiate Prince with princePath:
     	Prince prn =  new Prince("C:\\Program Files\\Prince\\Engine\\bin\\prince.exe");
          
    	//make an array of documents
    	String[] doc_array = {"C:\\docs\\test1.html", "C:\\docs\\test2.html"};

	//add a stle sheet
    	prn.AddStyleSheet("C:\\docs\\css\\stylesheet-1.css");

	//add a JavaScript
    	prn.AddJavaScript("C:\\docs\\js\\test.js");

	//set the log file
	prn.SetLog("C:\\docs\\log.txt");

	//call convertMultiple to convert the documents to a PDF file
    	prn.ConvertMultiple(doc_array, "C:\\docs\\pdf\\merged.pdf");
